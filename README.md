- `jest.setup.ts` - Testing environment setup with DOM matchers
- TypeScript configuration includes type definitions for Jest and Testing Library
- Full ESM (ECMAScript Modules) support
- Supports DOM testing with `@testing-library/jest-dom` matchers

### Scripts

### Testing
The project uses Jest and Testing Library for testing. Tests should be placed in either:
- `__tests__` directories
- Files with `.test.ts(x)` or `.spec.ts(x)` extensions

To run tests:
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

The coverage report will be generated in the `coverage` directory.
